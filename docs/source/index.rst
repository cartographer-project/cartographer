`Cartographer`_ is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization
and mapping (`SLAM`_) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor
configurations.

Getting started with ROS
========================

ROS integration is provided by the `Cartographer ROS repository`_. You will find
complete documentation for using Cartographer with ROS at the
`Cartographer ROS Read the Docs site`_.
