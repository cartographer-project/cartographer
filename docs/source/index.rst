   configuration

`Cartographer`_ is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization
and mapping (`SLAM`_) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor
configurations.

.. _Cartographer: https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer
.. _SLAM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping

Getting started
===============

Cartographer is a standalone C++ library. To get started quickly, use our `ROS
<http://www.ros.org>`_ integration.

Getting started with ROS
------------------------

ROS integration is provided by the `Cartographer ROS repository`_. You will find
complete documentation for using Cartographer with ROS at the
`Cartographer ROS Read the Docs site`_.

.. _Cartographer ROS repository: https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer_ros
.. _Cartographer ROS Read the Docs site: https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io

Getting started without ROS
---------------------------

Please see our ROS integration as a starting point for integrating your system
with the standalone library. Currently, it is the best available reference.

On Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty):

System Requirements
===================

Although Cartographer may run on other systems, it is confirmed to be working
on systems that meet the following requirements:

* 64-bit, modern CPU (e.g. 3rd generation i7)
* 16 GB RAM
* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) and 16.04 (Xenial)
* gcc version 4.8.4 and 5.4.0

Known Issues
------------

* 32-bit builds have libeigen alignment problems which cause crashes and/or
  memory corruptions.
